Why multiple commands?

This project structure is similar to [[https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/main/cmd][Prometheus]], [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd][Kubernetes]] etc. It's based
loosely on [[https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016][Peter Bourgon's "Go best practices, six years in"]] and
[[https://github.com/thockin/go-build-template][thockin/go-build-template]].

One benefit of doing this is to cut down on dependencies. The CLI doesn't need
=httprouter= and the server doesn't need =tablewriter= and so on. The resulting
binaries will be smaller and be less prone to unecessary software
vulnerabilities. The downside is that it creates a bit more complexity for
building the project, but it's not a hard problem to solve.

Alternatives could be to make a =-s= flag for running a server or creating
sub-commands with something like [[https://github.com/spf13/cobra][Cobra]].
