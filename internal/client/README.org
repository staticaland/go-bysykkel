* About

I decided to use an empty interface to make a helper function for HTTP requests
(=doRequest=).

An interface that does not implement any methods satisfies any type.

I discovered that =any= is an alias of =interface{}= in Go 1.18 and later.

I should learn more about [[https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics][generics]] ([[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-generics-in-go][DO]]).
